                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Welcome to The Children of The Sacred Green, a spiritual community nestled in the beautiful village of Whisper Bay. Founded by Iger and Xenara Moon, we seek to connect with nature through meditation, yoga, and communal living.</p>

                <h3>What We Believe</h3>
                <p>At The Children of The Sacred Green, we believe in the profound and ancient connection between humanity and the natural world. Our beliefs are rooted in the reverence of the natural, who we understand as ancient and powerful beings that have watched over the earth for millennia. These deities are embodiments of nature itself, representing the elements, the seasons, and the cycles of life.</p>
                <p>We are deeply inspired by the teachings of Wicca and various Far Eastern spiritual traditions, which emphasize harmony with nature, the cycles of the moon, and the importance of meditation and mindfulness. Our community strives to live in balance with the earth, cultivating our own food, and respecting the land that sustains us.</p>
                <p>We believe that spiritually haas been dormant for too long, neglected by a world that has moved away from nature. It is our sacred mission to awaken this connection and invite them back into our world. We do this through rituals, meditation, and a deep, intentional connection with the natural world. Our practices include honoring the cycles of the moon, celebrating the solstices and equinoxes, and conducting ceremonies that call upon the world around us for it's wisdom and guidance.</p>
                <p>We welcome all who feel a calling to reconnect with nature and the ancient truths that lie within. Our doors are open to those who seek spiritual growth, a deeper understanding of the world, and a community that values connection, respect, and the sacredness of life. Together, we strive to create a world where wisdom and love are honored and where humanity lives in harmony with the earth.</p>

                <h3>History of the Group</h3>
                <p>The Children of The Sacred Green was founded over three decades ago by Iger and Xenara Moon. When they moved to Whisper Bay they immediately fell in love with the serene beauty of the Cornish landscape and the rich history of the area. Initially, they opened a quaint bookstore that quickly became a beloved spot for locals and tourists alike.</p>
                <p>This bookstore  slowly became a place for people to get in touch with their spirituality. What started out as a capitalistic store quickly transformed into something more; a centre for people to reconnect with their inner selves. This profound journey of discovery led them to shift their focus from merely being bookstore owners to becoming spiritual guides.</p>
                <p>The Children of The Sacred Green began as a small group that met for yoga and meditation sessions, fostering a deep connection with nature and spirituality. The group grew organically, attracting individuals who were drawn to the Moons' vision of living in harmony with the earth</p>
                <p>The community flourished, attracting a diverse group of followers who shared a passion for nature and spirituality. The commune has always made it a point to be with and of the community. It's registered as an official religion and is proud to pay taxes. </p>
