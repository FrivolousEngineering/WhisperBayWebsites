                <p>We have personally used all of these remedies, and they have usually helped us -- even if they did not entirely solve my problem. We've found these remedies to be useful, mild and largely side-effect free. You should be aware that we cannot guarantee that you will have the same results. We personally never had an adverse reaction to any of these remedies, but that does not guarantee that you will not. Adverse effects are unpredictable, and you may have or develop an allergy to something in one of these remedies. You may notice that we also do not give dosage instructions. This is because the proper dose will vary from individual to individual. Taking too much of anything is dangerous, and one must be especially careful with all medicines (herbs are mdicines too). Use good judgement in using these remedies. Remember: None of this information is intended as a substitute for a doctor or other qualified health practicioner's advice.</p>

                <p>Drink mint tea (peppermint or wintergreen – not spearmint). This should help relieve sinus pressure/discharge. </p> 
                <p>
		If the allergy manifests as a rash or swelling, bathe the area in mint tea or Witch Hazel extract (avoid the eyes and other sensitive areas). If this doesn’t work, try bathing the area in a basil and water infusion (steep dried basil in warm water until the water has cooled). If any of these rinses burns or becomes too uncomfortable, rinse in clear water. Aloe Vera is a good treatment – cover the area with aloe and gently rub in or let it absorb. For itchy rashes, soaking in a tub of warm water with baking soda can help. For wet or weeping rashes, cover the area in honey and cover with bandages. Rinse after two hours. Aloe Vera is a good treatment – cover the area with aloe and gently rub in or let it absorb.

Avoiding meat in the week before menstruation and eating foods rich in vitamin E will reduce severity (broccoli, spinach, celery etc…). Soaking in a bath with Epsom salts can also help. </p>
