                            <h3>Who founded the Women's Institute?</h3>

                                <p><strong>Adelaide Hoodless</strong>, a Canadian leader and educationalist, is usually honoured as the founder of the Women's Institute Movement. She certainly inspired it, however, only played a limited role in its development.</p>
                                <p>Adelaide's husband John was the chairman of the local Board of Education and frequently visited schools in the city. Adelaide often accompanied him, which gave her <strong>considerable insight into the education system</strong>. As a result of her visits to schools, she came to think that the <strong>education of girls ought to be extended to include the practical skills</strong> that they would require when they grew up and ran homes and looked after families.<br><br>Adelaide was instrumental in setting up the Canadian National Council of Women in 1893 and persuaded them to back her campaign for the introduction of Domestic Science into the school curriculum.&nbsp;<strong>In December 1896</strong> she spoke at a conference of the Farmers' Institute at the Ontario Agricultural College, outlining the connection between&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.98em;">poor food, overwork and monotony with the high rate of insanity among rural people.</span></p>
                                <p><em>"...the causes are easily preventable by scientific knowledge of the various articles of food and their nutritive value, and...by the introduction of schools of domestic science in the rural districts, with lecture courses and clubs for farmers' wives, where better methods for producing good results in butter making, poultry raising, bee culture, house decoration, cookery etc. may be intelligently discussed…"</em><br><br>That call for continuing education for women living in rural areas had immediate results. Erland Lee, secretary of the Farmer's Institute of Wentworth County was in the audience and invited her to speak at the next 'Ladies' night' of his Institute. As a result of that talk, the first Women’s Institute was formed in Stoney Creek, Ontario (Canada).</p>
                                <p>The <strong>first WI of Great Britain</strong> was formed in <strong>1915 </strong>at the suggestion of Canadian woman <strong>Madge Watt</strong>. The pattern of the Canadian movement was followed and the name adopted.</p>

                            <h3>Why was the organisation called Women's Institute?</h3>
                        </div>
                        <article class="accordion__panel__content">
                            <div class="rte">
                                <p>The name ‘Institute’ was chosen because it was the<strong> women’s branch of the Farmer’s Institute</strong>. 'Institute' was the term used for a permanent organisation whose <strong>purpose was educational</strong>. In Britain, ‘Institute’ already had an honourable usage in the&nbsp;<em>Mechanics' Institutes</em>, educational establishments formed to provide adult education particularly in technical subjects to working men, and also in the City and Guilds Institute established as a national system of technical education.</p>

                            <h3>What is the difference between the NFWI and the WI?</h3>
                        </div>
                        <article class="accordion__panel__content">

                                <p><strong>NFWI</strong> stands for National Federation of Women’s Institutes and is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>running our charitable organisation as a whole.&nbsp;</strong>Its headquarters are located in Parsons Green, London.</p>
                                <p>There are&nbsp;<strong>70 federations</strong> spread across the UK. Imagine them as&nbsp;<strong>regional offices</strong>, linking all the WI in its area with the NFWI in London.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, <strong>every single WI belongs to a federation</strong>. As an example: the "Guernsey Lilies" belong to the Guernsey federation, just like the Selby Swans belong to the North Yorkshire East federation and so on.<br>As a result, when a woman joins her local WI, she<strong> becomes a member of that particular WI&nbsp;</strong>and not her regional federation or the NFWI.</p>

                            <h3>Why was Jerusalem chosen as the WI's anthem?</h3>
                        </div>
                        <article class="accordion__panel__content">
                            <div class="rte">
                                <p>Choosing Jerusalem as the WI anthem came as a<strong> result of a letter to the former WI membership magazine “Home &amp; Country”</strong> prior to the 8th Annual General Meeting in <strong>1924</strong>. Grace Hadow, Vice-Chair at the time, suggested its use after attending&nbsp;<em>“Exhibitions or Council meetings at which the whole assembly joined in singing Sir Hubert Parry's setting of Blake's Jerusalem.”&nbsp;</em>She pointed out that many WI members&nbsp;<em>“would like to sing the song at the upcoming Annual Meeting.”</em></p>
                                <p>After an impressive “performance” of Jerusalem at the AGM, the NFWI ran a competition for an 'Institute song' which ended in Jerusalem being chosen at the official Institute’s song.</p>
                                <p>Jerusalem had been <strong>used by the National Union of Suffrage Societies in the 1918 </strong>celebrations of women's enfranchisement, and many of the leaders of the NFWI, including Grace Hadow, had been part of that struggle to win the vote for women.<br>By singing Jerusalem, the WI is <strong>marking its links with the wider women's movement</strong>, and its commitment to improving the conditions of rural life.</p>

                                <p>Queen Mary invited Madge Watt, who founded the first WI in Great Britain, to form a WI at Sandringham, and Queen Mary became its President. This tradition was followed by future members of the Royal family.&nbsp;<strong>HM Queen Elizabeth II became a WI member in 1943</strong> when she was still Princess Elizabeth, when her Mother was President of Sandringham WI. HM Queen Elizabeth II then became President herself.</p>
                                <p>HRH The&nbsp;<strong>Duchess of Edinburgh</strong> is a member of Bagshot WI, Surrey and <strong>HM Queen Camilla</strong> is a member of Tetbury WI, Gloucestershire.</p>

                                <p>The NFWI is unable to campaign on everything that members may be interested in because&nbsp;<strong>there must be an existing mandate on the topic</strong>. Every issue that WI members work on stems from a resolution that has been put forward by a WI or federation and debated and voted on at the Annual Meeting. Every campaign topic is decided using this&nbsp;<strong>democratic framework</strong>, which ensures local WI members have the opportunity to set the direction of the national organisation's policy and campaigns.</p>
                                <p>If a member would like to campaign on a topic, they<strong> should follow the resolutions process</strong> outlined&nbsp;here to propose it as an area of concern for the entire organisation.</p>
                                <p>Whilst the NFWI is unable to sign petitions where we have no existing mandate, WI members are free to add their individual support, and the NFWI is always open to hearing from other related campaign groups who believe that their mission may fit within the WI's remit, or that members will be keen to get involved.</p>

                                <p>The resolutions, which are presented at the AM, have undergone&nbsp;<strong>a long and democratic process</strong>. To begin with, WI members send in resolutions to the public affairs department at the NFWI headquarter in London. A delegation of members, chosen by the federations, then decides on a shortlist of resolutions.</p>
                                <p>Once this list is published,&nbsp;<strong>all members can select the resolution that they support the most</strong> by completing the selection slip found in their membership magazine&nbsp;("WI Life").</p>
                                <p>These&nbsp;<strong>results are considered by the Board of Trustees</strong> in early spring, and the Board then takes into account any developments since the resolutions were submitted and agrees the final resolution/s that will go to the Annual Meeting.</p>
