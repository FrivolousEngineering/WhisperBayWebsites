                <p>At the Women's Institute of Whisper Bay, we strive to empower women, promote friendship, and contribute to the well-being of our community. Our institute is a place where women come together to share experiences, develop new skills, and support each other. Established in 1923, the Women's Institute of Whisper Bay has a long tradition of community service and social activities. Over the decades, we have been at the forefront of numerous community projects, from educational programs to charity events. Felicity Kempthorne has been the chairwoman of the Women's Institute for the past five years. Together with the hard working volunteers of the WI they are the driving force of all it's initiatives. </p>

                <h2>History and Archives</h2>
                <p>The National Federation of Women's Institutes (NFWI) is the overall body of the WI in England, Wales, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man, with headquarters in London and an office in Cardiff, NFWI-Wales. Each individual WI is a separate charitable organization, run by and for its own members with a constitution agreed at national level but the possibility of local bye-laws.</p>
                <p>WIs are grouped into Federations, roughly corresponding to counties or islands, which each have a local office and one or more paid staff. WI Enterprises is the trading arm of the organization and exists to raise funds and provide benefits for members.</p>
                <p>The NFWI produces a membership magazine, WI Life, which is published eight times a year and delivered to members.</p>
                <p>The archives of the National Federation of Women's Institutes are held at The Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics. The WI's archives are open to the public and provide a rich history of the organization's activities and contributions.</p>
                <p>Although we have an archive, of which you can find a few photographs below, we would recommend visiting the archives of the NFWI for a more indepth view of our history! </p>
