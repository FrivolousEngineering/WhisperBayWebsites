                <h2>Morwenna's Tears</h2>
                <img src="images/crying-woman-clipart.gif" alt="Morwenna's Tears" class="articleImage">
                <p>One of Whisper Bay's most enduring legends is the tale of Morwenna, a beautiful maiden who lived in the village centuries ago. Morwenna fell in love with a tin miner named Taran, but their love was forbidden due to a longstanding feud between their families. One fateful night, Taran was caught in a mine collapse and tragically died. Heartbroken, Morwenna wandered the cliffs above Whisper Bay, her tears forming a small, hidden waterfall that locals now call "Morwenna's Tears."</p>
                <p>Legend has it that those who bathe in its waters are said to gain the ability to see glimpses of the future. However, these visions come at a price: each time one looks into the future, a memory of the past is forgotten.</p>

                <img src="images/Beast.webp" alt="Beast of Bodmin Moor" class="articleImage">
                <p>A more terrifying tale is that of the Beast of Bodmin Moor, a creature that has been sighted near Whisper Bay on several occasions. Described as a large, black bull-like animal with glowing eyes, the Beast is believed to be a phantom that prowls the moorlands at night.</p>
                <p>According to local folklore, the Beast is the spirit of a witch’s familiar from the 17th century. The witch, known as Old Maud, was said to have been wrongfully accused of witchcraft and executed. Her familiar, a large black bull, disappeared into the moors and has been haunting them ever since. It is told that every person it kills in revenge for it's mistresses murder makes it grow even more. The most recent encounters describe a towering beast, who's horns nearly touch the top of the trees</p>

                <h2>The Whispering Stones</h2>
                <img src="images/stones.png" alt="Whispering Stones" class="articleImage">
                <p>Near the cliffs of Whisper Bay lies a circle of ancient standing stones, known to locals as the Whispering Stones. These stones are believed to be enchanted, and the folklore surrounding them is rich with tales of magic and mystery.</p>
                <p>Legend holds that the stones were placed there by the druids, who used them for rituals and ceremonies. During the summer solstice, it is believed that the stones come to life and whisper the history of the land to those who are pure of heart. But other, more darker tales speak of how these druids were forced to perform sacrifices in order to ensure a bountiful harvest. They also claim that dark times ask for ever greater sacrifices to stave off the impending doom. Perhaps the red stains on these stones are indeed caused by druids forced to sacrifice one of their own or perhaps it's a specific kind of lichen that only grows on these stones. Who can tell?!</p>

                <h2>The Phantom Miner</h2>
                <img src="images/Miner.webp" alt="Phantom Miner" class="articleImage">
                <p>The closure of the tin mine three years ago has rekindled stories of the Phantom Miner, a spectral figure that is said to haunt the old mining tunnels. The miner is believed to be the ghost of a worker who died in a tragic accident during the mine's heyday.</p>
                <p>According to the legend, the Phantom Miner appears to warn of impending disasters or to guide lost souls to safety. Some say that the Phantom Miner is a benevolent spirit, watching over the village and its people.</p>
