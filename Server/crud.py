The event was buzzing with delicious smells and happy faces, as dozens of cakes and pastries were laid out for judging. The star of the show? <strong>Mrs. Gwendoline Thomas</strong>, who wowed everyone with her Victoria Sponge. She took home the top prize, and the bake-off managed to raise over Â£500 for the local school. That moneyâ€™s going to be used to buy some much-needed science lab equipment, so a big thanks to everyone who participated and donated. Canâ€™t wait for next yearâ€™s sweet showdown!</p>",
